# Secret Messenger
The secret messenger is a decentralized messaging service that you can use to talk to your frens :)

Currently there is no front-end for the Secret Messenger, but we're working on it!

## Future Work
- Create a browser extension UI
- Implement permissioned viewing (see SNIP-20 permissioned viewing in SCRT docs)
- Implement connection-orientation
- Implement group messaging
